               Hm? This looks… so very familiar… yes, my eyes do not betray me! It’s so pure, woven of such lovely fibers, like the foam of rushing tides that birthed Aphrodite herself! It’s the very image of captainly beauty! Fantastique! I’m in love, simply in love! I knew I could count on you, ma cherie!

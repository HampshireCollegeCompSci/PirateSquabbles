               Oh? Have you found it? Let me...  ahaha! Oh, la la! Ohohoho! You must be joking, ma cherie! This is hardly fit for a captain! You couldn’t possibly be suggesting that I wear that.

               It’s hideous, frankly! No true captain would be caught dead wearing something so… so very… no, no! It just won’t do. You must try harder than that!
